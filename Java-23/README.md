# Java 23 Features

1) **Record Patterns**: Record patterns allow for more concise and readable destructuring of record types, enabling
   developers to extract components from records directly in pattern matching.
2) **Pattern Matching for Switch**: This feature enhances the switch statement by allowing patterns to be used in case
   labels, enabling more expressive and flexible control flow based on the structure of objects.

3)**Scoped Values**: Scoped values are a new feature that allows developers to define values that are scoped to a
specific context, such as a thread or a request. This can help reduce the complexity of managing state in
concurrent applications.
4)**String Templates**: String templates provide a way to create strings with embedded expressions, making it
easier to construct complex strings without the need for concatenation or formatting methods.
7)**Markdown Documentation**: Java 23 includes improved support for Markdown documentation, allowing developers to
write documentation in a more readable and structured format. This can enhance the clarity and maintainability of
code documentation.
