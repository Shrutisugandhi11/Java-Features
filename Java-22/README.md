# Java 22 Features ðŸš€

- **Region Pinning for G1** â†’ Improves performance of the G1 garbage collector by reducing pauses when interacting with
  native memory.
- **Foreign Function & Memory API** â†’ A safer, faster replacement for JNI to call native libraries and manage off-heap
  memory.
- **Unnamed Variables & Patterns** â†’ Use `_` for unused variables/patterns, making code cleaner and avoiding warnings.
- **Multi-file Program Launch** â†’ Run multi-file Java programs directly without compilation, like a script.
- **Class-File API** â†’ New API for reading, writing, and modifying `.class` files programmatically.
- **Stream Gatherers** â†’ Extend Java Streams with custom intermediate operations for more flexible data processing.
- **Statements Before `super`** â†’ Allows statements before `super(...)` in constructors, enabling validation or
  preprocessing.
- **Scoped Values (2nd Incubator)** â†’ Share immutable data across threads safely and efficiently, better than
  thread-local.
- **String Templates (2nd Preview)** â†’ Embed expressions directly inside strings for cleaner and safer formatting.
- **Implicit Classes & Main (2nd Preview)** â†’ Write quick scripts without class or main boilerplate (just write code!).
- **Structured Concurrency (Preview)** â†’ Manage multiple concurrent tasks as a single unit, simplifying error handling
  and cancellation.
- **Vector API (6th Incubator)** â†’ Leverage CPU vector instructions for high-performance math and data processing.
